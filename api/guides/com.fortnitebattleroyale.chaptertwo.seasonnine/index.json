Whether or not this is true is yet to be seen, but a pyramid fits with some of HYPEX's leaks, and there have been hints of Mad Max-style cars in the past.",

It is possible this will be the case, which means other members of The Seven may get involved. It is also possible that Midas may make a reappearance since Epic has focused three months of The Crew around his Shadow operatives.\n\nThere is also a new Batman/Fortnite crossover comic, one that features the Foundation and answers many questions about the Zero Point, the Seven, and Geno. The comic ends in way that it perfectly sets up the Foundation's return to Apollo Island, and he will hopefully play a bigger part in what comes next.",
