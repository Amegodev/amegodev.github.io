Download the digital wallet called MetaMask.\n2. Once that is set up, one must provide their MetaMask with some BNB tokens in order to have it converted via Binance.\n3. Once BNB is available in your MetaMask, you can then convert it into BCOIN using PancakeSwap.\n4. When that is also accomplished, you can head over to the official BomB Crypto webpage and connect your MetaMask.\nNote that the initial cost to start out in BomB Crypto is 10 BCOIN, equivalent to 1 Bomber Hero. You also have to maintain 10 BCOIN to be able to claim the coins and heroes you get as rewards.\n\nAt the time of writing, a single BCOIN is priced at PHP 184.65 (Back in September 2021, a single BCOIN was priced at only PHP 17.56).",

When they run out of energy, they will enter a resting state to recharge. If a house is bought, the energy charging speed will be increased.
