Be it the poor distribution of review codes or the social media minefield in the days after its release, to say that Baldo’s launch could have been better would be an understatement.\n\nIt’s a real shame. Ever since its announcement in an earlier Indie Direct, this Studio Ghibli-esque game with The Legend of Zelda-like gameplay has had players talking. The delay in 2020 didn’t seem to deter fans, with Baldo becoming a highly anticipated title within the gaming community. How times change eh?",

You only need look as far as the recently released Eastward to see how much polish is lacking here, but that isn’t to say that Baldo isn’t deserving of your time.\n\nBaldo’s biggest challenge right now is gaining the confidence of the gaming community. Two hot fixes were applied within its first month, directly addressing all manner of bugs that make it much more playable. The larger concern though is that a game of this size has so many variables to contend with, it’s likely that not all bugs have been encountered yet, let alone fixed. I have every faith that NAPS Team will continue to work to address any issues that do appear — after all, there is 15 years’ worth of work invested in this.\n\nMy time with Baldo has been, for the most part, entertaining.
