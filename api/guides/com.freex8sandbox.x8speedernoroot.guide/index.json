When she reaches the bottom floor, she will reach a dead end and is forced to go back, but in her way is a shadowy shape of a toy rabbit, which then grows into a giant monster. What previously was a dead end, is now a seemingly endless hallway where Esther runs as far as she can as a giant hand comes for her. Escape from the hand is impossible. When caught, Esther sees the image of a girl being burned. Esther awakens from her nightmare, and it seems she has woken up the other children in the orphanage as well. Come morning, Esther talks with her friends, Molly and Isaac. She says she has the same dream over and over again. While Isaac suggests that it means something, Molly believes Esther is just going crazy. The head matron, Miss Beverley, gives the children a box of donated toys, 3 specific toys stick out; a tiger, a panda, and a rabbit. When Esther reaches for the rabbit, she gets the glimpse of the burning girl, 6 symbols, and the rabbit. Esther says she feels she seen the rabbit before, Isaac finds them unsettling, but Molly thinks they're adorable. Molly calls takes the panda toy and calls it Miss Bo, Isaac calls the tiger toy Mr. Stripes, and Esther calls the rabbit Mr. Hopp.",
