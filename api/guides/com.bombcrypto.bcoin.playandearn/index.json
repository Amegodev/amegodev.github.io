The SMGs are very versatile. At low to medium ranges, they dominate, and with some clever burst fire, they can be very useful on longer angles too.

This is true of both individual firefights and entire rounds. You will at times find yourself in a losing round, and it is better to save yourself and your gun. Economy is very important in Warface, and it is much better to lose the battle to win the war.\n\nSimilarly, getting into a firefight should take some thought. You don't want to get caught in a 1v3 position while trying to get an early peek or kill. Rather, ensure that you have as much information possible before you do pick a fight. Remember, your health is your most valuable resource and use it judicially.",

However, once you are a bit more familiar with the game, try experimenting with new strategies in these modes. These modes are also good for experimenting with weapons and equipment you don't use a lot.\n\nSome weapons are very good in particular situations. The casual modes can help you find these situations, and experiment with them. The shotgun, for example, is surprisingly good at more ranges than you'd expect. Similarly, the smoke, at some angles, can completely block off the opponent teams and stop a rush dead in its tracks. Play around in the casual modes, and take what you learn from that to ranked.",

Whether you go all out and buy the most expensive equipment every round you can or you save up a few rounds to get that shiny sniper rifle or a machine gun. Managing and adapting your economy across rounds and strategies is very important. Ideally, you want to be saving money for the first few rounds and ensure that you can buy an assault rifle or submachine gun every round, but that's not always possible. Depending on the team you're facing, it might be smarter to spend more to get over an early disadvantage or to extend an early lead.",
