A matron can be seen walking back and forth between an open cardboard box and a bookshelf. Esther has to hide behind the closed cardboard boxes to not get noticed by the matron. After making it past the living room, Esther has to get the key to the storage room by hiding from Miss Beverly. At the far end of the storage room, Billy's ball can be seen on a cardboard box. Mr. Hopp can also be seen behind one of the other cardboard boxes. Upon collecting the ball, a giggle from an unknown girl can be heard. Going past the wardrobe in the middle of the room will result in Mr. Hopp grabbing her, and she must struggle to get free. Failing to do so will send Esther back to her last checkpoint. If she successfully gets free, Mr. Hopp will let go, and Esther will deny that it could've been real and that she just needs sleep. When Esther brings the ball back to Billy, he reveals that he isn't actually certain where Molly is, but suggests that Esther looks in the second floor bedroom, located in the east wing.",

Esther picks her up, questioning why she's sitting there all by herself. At the hallway with the two big paintings and a bookshelf, Esther sees Dee standing near the entrance to the main hall. Before Esther can ask if she's seen Molly, Dee asks her if she can hear the whispers and the evil that roams the halls. When going back towards the children's room, Esther finds that Isaac is no longer there, and Mr. Stripes' claws can be seen at the curb of the open area. Upon approaching the claws, Mr. Stripes will go back into the darkness. Esther reports the absence of Molly and Isaac to matron Ruth, who says that they're hiding somewhere and they'll be dealt with accordingly, and that Esther should stop worrying and go back to bed. Esther goes to sleep and has another dream.",
